***********  PODS *************


Pods: definition of how tro run a container
In docker to run a container, we use
docker run -d -p -v --network -

In Kubernetes, we use  yaml file

pod can be single container/multiple containers
pod is excatly similar to docker container
instead of docker run or command line

we put all in yaml file
-API VERSION
-INFO OF container
-specification of containers

Why this complexity as its enterprise level platform, declarative mode, standardisation

pod resources
services
deployment


*** side car containers, init containers ****

one or group of containers in a single pod, then Kubernetes will allow
-shared networking
-shared storage
eg: container A want to talk to container B localhost : 3000, share files

cluster ip address genereated to PODS not to containers..
PODS are wrappers..
access them using clusterip adrees given by KUBEPROXY
