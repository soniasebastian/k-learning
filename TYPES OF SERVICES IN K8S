What are the different types of services within kubernetes?

There are three differentr type sof services that a user can create
1. Cluster IP mode...CLUSTER NETWORK...
2. Node port...node ip address...ec2 INSTANCE....ACCESS WORKER NODE
3. Load balancer mode..OUSITE WORLD...EXPOSE ..C-CM CREATE PUBLIC IP ADDRESS..ALSO USED BY INGRESS.....

What is the difference between Node port and Loadbalancer type service?

When a service is cerated a Node port type, the Kube proxy updates the IP tables with Node IP adress and port that is chosen in the service cinfiguration to access the pods

where as if you create a service as type Loadbalancer, the C-CM creates a external load balancer IP using the underlying cloud provider logic in C-CM. users can  access services using external IP
