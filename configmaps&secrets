**********  CONFIG MAPS & SECRETS ****************


  USER
  APP(BACKEND)
  DATABASE

user needs the following infor from DB:
  db port
  db user
  password
  connectors


WE WONT HARDCODE THESE INFORMATION...BUT SAVE THEM AS ENV VARIABLES....IN FILESYSTEM
    WE USE OS MODULES.....like java support....

Inside Kubernetes:
  we need DB port & DB Connection type
Kubernetes basically deals with containers....
    to support these k8S HAVE CONFIG MAP
create a confid map we can store values, mount this config map as env variables
use them as env variables/ volume mounts


Config maps solves the problem of storing the data ............DB PORT, DB CONNECTION TYPE (non-sensitive data)
  ......ETCD..DATA STORED ASOBJECTS..HACKER CAN RETRIEVE INFORMATION, ENTIRE PLATFORM ET COMPROMISED IF EVRYTHING IS STORED IN IT  


  *********  why secrets ***********

  But secret deals with sensitive data

  DB USERNAME
  DB PASSWORD


  before the data gets stored in ETCD 
  we will encyrpt data before it gets stored in secrets

  *** custom enryption ******
as no decryption data


user...yaml..kubectl apply...creates config map.....API server is saving the info in ETCD....

  SECRETS...RBAC...
  LEAST PRIVILEGE .....LESS ACCESS 

  both store infor/pass information/
  eg json data, key-value pair..pods
  secrets..sensitive
  config maps-non-sensitive


  secrets data encrypted/RBAC..ONLY DEVOPS ENGINEER WILL HAVE ACCESS..
