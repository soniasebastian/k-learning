What are the main components of K8s architecture?

On a broad level, you can divide the k8s components in two parts
1. Control plane (API SERVER, SCHEDULER, CONTROLLER MANAGER, C-CM, ETCD)
2. Data plane (Kubelet, kube-proxy, Container Runtime)...kube DNS
KUBELET MANAGES PODS, STARTING , RUNNING
KUBEPROXY....SERVICE NODEPORT...UPDATE IPTABLES....REQUEST HAS TO BE SEND...TAKES CARE OF NETWORKING
CONTAINER RUNTIME....K8S DOCKERSHIM, CRIO, CONTAINER-D..INSTALL IN EACH AND EVERY NODE


  KUBERENETS IS NOT USING DOCKER SHIM
  IT SUPPORTS DOCKERSHIM
  ANY CONTAINER RUNTIME THAT IMPLEMNTS INTERFACE IS OK
