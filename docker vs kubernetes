What is the difference b'w Docker and Kubernetes?
  Docker is a container platform where as Kubernetes is a container orchestration environment that offers capabilities like Auto healing, 
  Auto-scaling, Clustering and Enterprise level support like Loadbalanace, integration with custom resource definition, ingress controllers offering advanced capabilities
    

    In docker containers goes down/Â app goes down/end users experience the  traffic loss/ container orchestartion platform K8s is good choice
    k8 is a cluster
    In production env we can join cluster, imemdiately moves that pod to another pod

    Docker is a single node platform, if goes down app is not accessible
