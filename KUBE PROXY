What is the role of kube proxy?
Kube-proxy works by maintaining a set of network rules on each node in the cluster, which are updated dynamically as services are added or removed.
When a client sends a request to a service, teh request is intercepted by kubeproxy on the node where it is received.
kube-proxy then looks up the destination endpoint for the service and routes the request accordingly

kube proxy is an essential component of a kubernetes cluster, as it ensures that services can communicated with each other.
