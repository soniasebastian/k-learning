*********  Kubernetes Ingress ***********

Initailly loadbalances like nginx, F5 etc in virtual or physical servers
Enterprise loadbalancing offers very good loadbalancing, ratio based loadbalancing, sticky sessions (1 pod then request to that pod), path based lb, domain based,whitelisting, blacklisting
from VMs to K8s, very happy as it offers autoscaling, autohealing, service discovery, expose app to external world
deploy...service.....provides LB which is a simple......RoundRobin mechanism....kube-proxy..updates IPTABLES....POD1 5..POD2 5
COMEMRCIAL LOADBALANCE OFFERS 100's of features ........security using TLS
LB mode service .....100 services....Cloud provider charge them with every ip adress as they are static IP address, static public IP addresses....


*************     PROBLEMS  with K8s services   **************
1) Enterprise & TLS loadbalance(security)
sticky sessions
TLS
Pathbased
Hostbased
Ratiobased...15/20

2) Service of type: Loadbalancer
Cloud provider will charge you for each and every type of services LBs for static public IP address

Redhat Opendhift...routers

Loadbalancer:
nginx
F5
ambassador
treafik
HA proxy


User Create Ingress resource....K8s asked to create ingress controller by nginx, F5 ...how to install ingress controllers....
INGRESS CONTROLLERS ARE LBS with API GATEWAYS



pod....kubelet..deplo
service..kubeproxy...IPtables


sECURITY AND LOADBALANCING VERY ESSENTIAL..............


WE NEED INGRESS CONTROLLER.......ITS A LOADBALANCER.....eg...nginx, F5, HA-Proxy, Traefik etc....
