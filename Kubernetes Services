**********  Kubernetes SERVICES  ***************

what is no service in Kubernetes?

Deploy will create a pod in k8s 
create replica sets
create pods
concurrent : use at same time


eg: Whatsapp users access concurrently
no of connections 1 replica of application can take/handle
if 100..1 replica set can handle 10 requests then 10 replica sets
adv :Autohealing

Containers are ephemeral in nature


172.16.3.4
172.16.3.5
172.16.3.6

if first changes to 172.16.3.8
then deploy uses Service..SVC
Service uses kubeproxy offers Loadbalancers ...forward requests...

payment.default.svc

if no service in k8s , even if we have deployment and pods , even if application fails the IP address changes and will not allow autohealing property
*******   solved by Service by loadbalancing   ************

*******   Service Discovery :Labels & Selectors ************  

Problem: track of deployment, which is creating 3 pods, one iP adress is changes, track this 
I am not bothered about IP adress changes

eg Goggle...50-60 pods
service manually keeps track of this problem , it is not possible

Label created eg: payments ...watch for these labels
replica set controller will use deployment.yml
label is same problem gets solved


creates a deployment...yaml manifest.. inside metadat....create label
app:payment
deploy....> RS......> POD 1, 2, 3 with label: app:payment for all pods


**************  EXPOSE TO EXTERNAL WORLD *******************

WHOEVER HAS ACCESS TO CLUSTER
USING SSH IP ADRESS

But in real world scenario, this is not the case
Kubernetes cannot offer this directly
endusers in italy, austria...you are in my network, we cant say

A SERVICE CAN EXPOSE YOUR APPLICATION FOR ACCESSING OUSITE K8 CLUSTER
....... YAML.MANIFEST..........
SERVICE OF 3 TYPES
1) CLUSTER IP...INSIDE K8 CLUSTER  ***** 2 BENEFITS...DICOVERY/LOADBALANCING...container/ cluster network adress..only devops engineers
2) NODE PORT........ INSIDE ORGANISATION..WORKER NODE IP ADRESS ONLY THEY CAN ACCESS ...having VPC nodes access
3) LOADBALANCER..............EXTERNAL WORLD ....EKS..PUBLIC IP ADDRESS...DEPENDS ON CLOUD PROVIDERS ...WONT WORK IN MINIKUBE LOCAL SYSTEMS...*********  SOLVED BY INGRESSS **********

payments.default.SVC

SERVICE GETS RESOLVED


LOADBALANCE...AWS....EKS....ELB...public ip adreess...given by cloud controller manager..

Anyone with access to internet can access the application as service typr is loadbalancer
