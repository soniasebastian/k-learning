*******  RBAC ******************
Role based access control
1.user management access
2.deal with service accounts access


pods have access to configmap
pods have access to secrets


1. service accounts/users
2. roles/cluster role
3. rolebinding /Cluster role binding


kubernetes offloads user management to IDENTITY PROVIDERS
Each of them should have only respective access developers/QE /DEVOPS PEOPLE


In kuberenetes we have API server works as OAuth server....
offload usermanagment to Identity providers....
IAM users we can login to kuberenetes
IAM OAuth provider


LDAP
OKTA
SSO...IDENTITY PROVIDERS
KEYCLOAK....BROKEReg: EKS....KEYCLOAK..GITHUB COLLOBORATION....



SERVICE ACCOUNTS...YAML FILE...JUST LIKE CREATING PODS


role/cluster is yaml file users..they have to access configmap, secrets
rolebinding/cluster


namespace...role
cluster...rolebinding
