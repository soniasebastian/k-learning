Docker vs Kubernetes

Docker is a container platform, interaction with container, provides container lifecycle.
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform
Containers are ephemeral in nature (shortliving in nature, containers can die and ger revived in anytime)

1. Single host
Container 1 is taking all resources and container 100 not able to live and dies...nature of docker is scoped to single host...

2. Autohealing
Application running inside container is not accessible
Autohealing is a behaviour without users manual intervention
100 reasosn for a container can go down
Devops person cant monitor 10,000 containers
docker ps cannot be done for knowing all running containers

3. Autoscaling
